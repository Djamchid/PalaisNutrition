  "correct-answer": "Correct!",
  "wrong-answer": "Incorrect.",
  
  "q1": "According to traditional Chinese medicine, 'warm' foods like ginger and cinnamon are recommended when:",
  "q1-a": "You have a cold or are feeling chilled",
  "q1-b": "You have a fever or inflammation",
  "q1-c": "You're doing intense exercise",
  "q1-correct": "a",
  "q1-explain": "Traditional Chinese medicine considers a cold as a 'cold' imbalance that requires 'warm' foods like ginger to restore the body's energetic harmony. Warm foods are not recommended for fever, as they could worsen the 'heat' type imbalance.",
  
  "q2": "Which statement is scientifically correct regarding lipids (fats) in the diet?",
  "q2-a": "All fats are bad for health and should be avoided",
  "q2-b": "Some fatty acids are essential and cannot be produced by our body",
  "q2-c": "Saturated fats are healthier than unsaturated fats",
  "q2-correct": "b",
  "q2-explain": "Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are essential fatty acids that our body cannot synthesize. They play crucial roles in cell function, cardiovascular health, and brain development. It is therefore important to include them in the diet through sources such as fatty fish, nuts, and certain vegetable oils.",
  
  "q3": "In Chinese dietary tradition, rice is considered:",
  "q3-a": "A neutral food, good for general balance",
  "q3-b": "A hot food that stimulates yang",
  "q3-c": "A cold food that strengthens yin",
  "q3-correct": "a",
  "q3-explain": "In traditional Chinese medicine, white rice is considered a neutral food, making it an excellent staple food suitable for all types of constitutions. This neutrality allows it to harmonize with different foods and serve as a balancing base in many meals.",
  
  "q4": "According to modern nutritional knowledge, which of these statements about proteins is correct?",
  "q4-a": "Complete proteins are only found in animal products",
  "q4-b": "It's impossible to get enough protein on a vegetarian diet",
  "q4-c": "An adequate combination of plant sources can provide all essential amino acids",
  "q4-correct": "c",
  "q4-explain": "Proteins are made up of amino acids, some of which are 'essential' because our body cannot synthesize them. While animal products generally contain all essential amino acids, a thoughtful combination of plant foods (such as legumes and grains) can also provide all the essential amino acids necessary for proper body function.",
  
  "q5": "What fundamental principle does traditional Chinese medicine apply to dietary balance?",
  "q5-a": "Consuming mainly one type of food at a time",
  "q5-b": "Seeking harmony between the five flavors to balance the organs",
  "q5-c": "Avoiding mixing hot and cold foods in the same meal",
  "q5-correct": "b",
  "q5-explain": "Traditional Chinese medicine recommends balancing the five flavors (sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, and salty) as each is associated with an internal organ and an element. For example, the sour flavor is linked to the liver and the wood element, while bitter is associated with the heart and fire. A balance between these flavors promotes organ harmony and energy (qi) flow throughout the body.",
